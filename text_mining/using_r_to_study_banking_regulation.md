# Using R to study banking regulation

Authors: Eryk Walczak (Bank of England) 

# Description 

This talk will focus on computational approaches (scraping, NLP, and network analysis) used to describe and understand banking regulation. The banking reforms that followed the financial crisis of 2007–08 led to an increase in UK banking regulation from almost 400,000 to over 720,000 words, and to concerns about their complexity. A wide variety of approaches has been tested to understand this complexity. I will describe how we used R to study legal documents. The outcome of this project has been published as a Bank of England working paper: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2019/the-language-of-rules-textual-complexity-in-banking-reforms
