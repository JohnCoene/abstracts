# Why Python for NLP and R for TM?

Authors: Filippo Chiarello (University of Pisa) 

# Description 

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is  the field that studies how artificial intelligence can enable machines to process (unstructured) textual data. Once these sources  has been processed, Text Mining (TM) techniques aims at automatically extract information and discover new hidden knowledge. 

While the standard packages for NLP are nowadays written in Python (e.g. Spacy, NLTK), there is still a lack of standard for Text Mining Packages. In my talk i will explain why Python has reached the status of standard for NLP research, and why it is important for R user who want to work with text, to know these tools. From here, I will move to recent development in Text Mining tools developed in R, with a specific focus on the Tidytext package, by Julia Silge. I will explain why doing text mining in a tidy framework is a huge game changer, and I will show some potential next steps for the R community in order to contribute even more to this field of research. I will also focus on how the Reticulate (the R interface to Python) can integrate NLP and TM in R in an efficient and tidy way.

The goal of my talks is to give to newbie and practitioners of NLP and TM in R a global framework of tools in order to clarify what is most important for our work of text miner. The talk will be a starting point to understand what skills and tools are important to know in these ever and fast growing fields.
