# Description 

This paper is aimed to develop an instructional design for students with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) in the mainstream classroom. In conducting the study, the designer did an observation of the student with ADHD in an English classroom and an interview with the classroom teacher. The instructional product is designed based on the result of observation and interview. The instructional product serves as a guide for an English teacher to identify appropriate instructions and tools that meet student’s needs. A lesson plan, as one of the components of instructional design, expects student to be able to describe animals using proper vocabulary and correct grammar as the desired result of his performance. Based on the feedback given by the expert teacher, the design is applicable for ADHD student in learning a topic about describing animals in English. The design proposes more pictures or illustrations in presenting the lesson in order to cater the student’s learning style.
