# “Liberate” the R programmer and “empower” the non programmer

Authors: Faris Naji (Tercen) Marion Libouban

# Description 

This talk is about how to “liberate” the R programmer and “empower” the  non programmer for data analysis by using the R Tercen open science framework.



R programmers spend time dealing with the operational details of data analysis, such as user support, visual cosmetics, modifications of visuals for publications of non programmers and deployment of workflows and data for  non programmers publications. The pressure is even more acute when the ratio of  non programmers to R programmers is large. R programmers generally wish to be liberated from operational tasks in order to focus more intensely on research such as data algorithms and new approaches.



Tercen liberates the R programmer by offering a unique and novel visual computing paradigm and a unique R plug-in architecture and data model. Additionally it brings concepts such as, incremental visualization and data source derivation and more.



I will present R Tercen use cases where I outline the liberation and empowerment of researchers.
