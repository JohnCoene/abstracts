# Geospatial Data Mining using R

Authors: Guanqun Cao (Volvo Cars Corporation) 

# Description 

Geospatial data mining is an important topic with a wide spectrum of applications including traffic safety analysis, disease mapping, and weather forecast. Particularly, Bayesian methods are applied in this field to tackle the point-reference spatial data. We will show a set of R packages which enable us to conduct the analysis using the public dataset of US traffic accident prediction. Spatial data processing, mapping and analysis using R will be presented specifically in this talk.
