# Description 

Imagine you are planning your vacation. Your friends discuss where to stay, so that you can reach as many points of interest as possible in a given amount of time? The other way round, what destination are in your action radius. 

This contribution deals with timetables of public transport, which we interpret as a description of a network. We are using R to find shortest Paths through this network. At the end, we show how to present the solution in expressive maps to guide the user to its dream vacation.
