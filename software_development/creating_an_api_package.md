# Creating an API Package

Authors: Andrew Collier(Exegetic Analytics)Matt Dennis

# Description 

An API is a great way to get your hands on a swathe of data. However, interacting directly with an API, even using superb packages like {httr}, can be painful. An API Package provides a neat wrapper around an API so that its functionality is easily accessible from R. There are numerous examples of great API packages, like {rtweet}, {telegram} and {googledrive}. In this practical talk we’ll demonstrate the process of creating an API package (using the Trundler API as an example) and also discuss best practices.
