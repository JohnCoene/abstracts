Authors: Dominik Rafacz (Warsaw University of Technology) 

# Description 

Tibble is a safer and more convenient substitute for the classic data.frame. It is the basic class used in the tidyverse and is integrated into all its packages. Among the biggest advantages of tibble is the use of generic programming for data storage, resulting in high readability of printing and easy expandability. During the presentation, I will show the most important differences between tibble and data.frame. I will also demonstrate how you can easily add support for your own data type, using the example of biological sequences in tidysq package.
