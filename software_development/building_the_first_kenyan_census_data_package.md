# Building the first Kenyan Census data package

Authors: Shelmith Kariuki (Independent Consultant) None

# Description 

rKenyaCensus is a package that contains the results (data) of the 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census. The aim of this piece of work was to make inaccessible data accessible to the public, by converting data published in pdfs, into a machine readable format. These data can now easily be used by different government or non-governmental agencies in policy formulation. It has been used to assess Covid19 high risk areas in Kenya, by examining the counties that are crowded, and also examining the distribution of people with disabilities in the country.
