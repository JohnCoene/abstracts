Using renv and docker for development environments

**Keywords**: project structure, reproducible, workflow, development environment, collaboration



R is a great tool for fast data analysis. It’s simplicity in setup combined with powerful features and community support makes it a perfect language for many subject matter experts e.g. in finance or bioinformatics. Nevertheless what is often the case is that the code that is providing a great solution, application or model is not easily distributed to colleagues, outside the team or on the production servers. 



Both Appsilon and I personally have taken part in many R projects for which the goal was to clean and organise the project structure. Data science teams working for our clients have all the expert knowledge and skills required to deliver the value, but they are missing the programming experience required to provide a mature, reproducible and production quality environment.



I would like to share our approach on how to set up a proper development environment to share code shamelessly.
