# renv and drake: reproducible data science projects in R

Authors: Jakub Ka≈Ça

# Description

Massive computations performed both in academia and industry increase the need for reproducible data science. As data analysis becomes more sophisticated, reproducibility is the key factor to ensure the correctness of the whole process. 

When it comes to reproducibility in R, two packages are essential. The renv package is a dependency management toolkit. It preserves to package the ecosystem of a project and streamlines its recreation on other systems. The drake package is a tool for the maintenance of complex computation workflows. Once a dependency structure for a project is created, drake automatically tracks changes in the workflow and point out elements that need to be updated. 

During my presentation, I will showcase the interplay of renv and drake in a large machine learning project.
