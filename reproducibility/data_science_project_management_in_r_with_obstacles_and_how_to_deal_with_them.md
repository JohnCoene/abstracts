# Description 

Satisfying user’s needs is a struggle known for every programmer involved in a project with at least one collaborator. Changing assumptions, new insights, and surprising alterations in the data and data analysis framework significantly impact how we manage the code and the project itself. As mostly inevitable,  there is a need for a good strategy to adjust to the situation without overly complicating and tools helping to solve such issues.



I have participated in the development of the data analysis framework for emerging an experimental method. It was supposed to be a simple, three months-long project. After reaching the milestone almost two years later, I share my experience of containing the damage, refactoring the code, and planning ahead. During my presentation, I am presenting tools for R developers, which helped me in project management. Amongst mentioned packages, one can find renv, checkmate, testthat, and many others.
