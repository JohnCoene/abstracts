# platypus - image segmentation and object detection made easy with R

Authors: Michal Maj (Billennium) 

# Description 

With the release of the R Keras package (https://keras.rstudio.com/) (by JJ Allaire and Francois Chollet) at the end of 2017 / beginning 2018 the topic of artificial neural networks and especially deep learning in R became red-hot within the R community.



'platypus' is an R package that allows you to build advanced deep learning models like YOLO3 and U-Net for object detection and image segmentation tasks. Thanks to build in data generators and ready to go architectures you can implement perfect solution with a few lines of code.
