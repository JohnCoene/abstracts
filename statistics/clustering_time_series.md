# Description 

The data mining technique of time series clustering is well established in many fields.  However, as an unsupervised learning method, it requires making choices that are nontrivially influenced by the nature of the data involved. The aim of this presentation is to show usefulness of the time series clustering methods based on paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04004.pdf. By extensively testing various possibilities, we arrived at a choice of a dissimilarity measure (compression-based dissimilarity measure, or CDM) which is particularly suitable for clustering time series.
