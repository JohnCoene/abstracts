# Description 

Outlier detection is a key part of data preparation in empirical studies. Training the models on biased data will result in wrong conclusions. In multiple areas, eg. fraud detection or medical studies separation of anomalies might be the aim of studies on it's own. SOM is a well known unsupervised neural network, mainly used for grouping purposes. Clustering abilities of the algorithm combined with resistant to outliers self training process appears to be very useful in anomaly detection. The research has shown promising results on both dummy and empiricaldata, adding a great value of visualization of the results.
