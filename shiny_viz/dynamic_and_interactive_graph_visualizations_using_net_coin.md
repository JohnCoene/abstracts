# Description 

This paper presents an interactive dynamic tool for graph visualizations. This kind of graphs have been employed not only to solve topographic problems and to represent network structures, such as those in social media, but also to show the correlation between variables according to casual models. Path analysis and structural equations models are indeed well known by social scientists, but both were restricted to quantitative variables at their early stages. In this presentation, we will propose a new way to display social media, and connections between qualitative variables in a similar way to the correspondence analysis, but using another set of multivariate techniques, such as linear and logistic regression, mixed with network analysis. For example, one of the specific uses of this analysis technique involves the characterization of different response profiles by diverse sociodemographic variables.

The NCA (network coincidence analysis) explores links or co-occurrences of people, characteristics, or events under certain circumstances. The R package netCoin implements this coincidence analysis and generates attractive interactive data visualizations. This package allows you to analyze relationships in survey data, connections using social media data, or any other type of network data by drawing interactive plots. netCoin can also be used to visualize statistical models like linear regressions or structural equation modelling.
