# Supporting your community using R Shiny

Authors: Astrid Radermacher (Exegetic) Matthew Dennis

# Description 

It has become more and more important to consumers to support businesses and community projects that are owned/run by members of marginalised groups - voting with their money for projects they want to see flourish. Often, information about these businesses and organisations are spread only by word of mouth. We wanted to address this gap by creating a Shiny app as a central repository of information about local LGBTQIA+ owned and operated businesses in Cape Town, South Africa. We hope that by open sourcing the data collection process and code, this project will enable members of other communities to create similar platforms for their members.
