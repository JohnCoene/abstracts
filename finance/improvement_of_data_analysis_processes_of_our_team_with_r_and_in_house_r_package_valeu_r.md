Authors: Takuma KOSHIISHI (VALUES, Inc.) 

# Description 

VALUES, Inc. is Japanese tech company that applies data technology to innovate the marketing world.

We will be introducing our in-house R package called "valeuR" which is developed by our data-analysis team without requiring high-level engineering skills.

The valeuR is designed to increase efficiency and reproducibility of our analysis work.

The main concept of the project was to utilize pre-existing services and OSS from R and other languages.

In this way, even non-engineer data analysts can make R a powerful engineering tools.

For example, using an R package that can connect to cloud services such as AWS, we can develop simple but powerful functions.

We can also use libraries from other languages with V8 and reticulate package in R. Using valeuR, most of our work can be done in RStudio.

All these features are available in valeuR; then, our data analysts can expand the set of solvable problems with R. We will explain actual cases in which the valeuR has improved our data-analysis process.
