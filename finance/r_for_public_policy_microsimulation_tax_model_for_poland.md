# R for public policy - Microsimulation tax model for Poland

Authors: Justyna Klejdysz (Ministry of Finance of Poland) 

# Description 

Microsimulation is a key policy tool to make ex-ante evaluations of alternative tax proposals, compare them with respect to  financial costs and welfare implications.

We present a microsimulation model developed at the Ministry of Finance of Poland to evaluate changes in the Polish income tax and assess distributional impacts of tax proposals.

The model is fully implemented in R and relies on detailed taxpayer-level data from PIT and Social Insurance Institution (ZUS) databases.

The model simulates baseline and multiple scenarios and generates reports for policy analysis, providing information on total revenue, effective tax rates, winners and losers of a reform, and some inequality measures, such as the distribution of after-tax income, Gini coefficient and percentile ratios. Simulation output is aggregated by income deciles and main income source.

The purpose of the model is to provide policymakers with quick estimates of tax revenue implications and compliment further analysis on macro-level, such as the impact of a tax reform on employment.
