# Multithreading computing in R

Authors: Maria Kubara (WNE UW) 

# Description 

The general efficiency of computations in R highly depends on the packages we get our functions from. There are cases of exceptionally effective and optimized source codes, but the necessity to deal with less optimal ones in not so uncanny. Especially while performing large scale simulations small inefficiencies in the code can add up to an extremely long execution time. There are some solutions though that may allow you to utilize more computational power and, as a result, significantly shorten the time needed for the calculations. In the presentation the idea of multithreading computing will be provided with some tips and tricks on how to use it in one’s code. The advantages of such approach will be presented on a vast spatial dataset, that on its own poses a large computational challenge.
